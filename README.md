A simple CPP program I wrote when learning recursion in early highschool

Asks the user for a number of rows and columns, then fills the area with "blobs" (*). After generating the grid, it asks the user for a position on the board, proceeding to then check that section for a blob. If there is one it counts all of the blobs connected to each other. If not it returns 0.
